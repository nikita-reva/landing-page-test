# landing-page-test
Just trying some stuff out.

Demo:
https://nikita-reva.github.io/landing-page-test/.


I built this with the help of this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0wCewl87ec.

I added the text transitions and improved the mobile friendliness a little bit.

The image slider used in this project is absolutely awesome and I will definetely use in my own projects.
